## When you might need a commercial license

You can use `qpipe` under the AGPL (including for commercial purposes) **if you comply with the AGPL’s conditions**.

A commercial license may be appropriate if you:

- want to **distribute** `qpipe` or a modified version as part of a **closed-source / proprietary** product and do not want to disclose source code as required by the AGPL;
- want to **modify** `qpipe` and provide it to users over a network but cannot or do not want to satisfy the AGPL’s source-offer requirements for the version you run;
- have internal policy constraints (e.g., “no AGPL”) or compliance requirements that make AGPL usage impractical;
- need commercial terms such as (examples, subject to negotiation):
  - warranty / support / SLAs
  - indemnities
  - specific usage rights, distribution rights, or sublicensing rights
  - audit / compliance documentation

## What the commercial license typically provides

Commercial licenses vary, but commonly grant:

- the right to **use, modify, and distribute** `qpipe` under agreed terms without the AGPL copyleft obligations;
- optional commercial support and other negotiated terms.

All details (scope, fees, support, warranties, etc.) are defined only in the executed commercial agreement.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can my company use `qpipe` for free under the AGPL?
Yes — commercial use is permitted under OSI open-source licenses, including the AGPL, provided you comply with the license’s terms.

### If I have a commercial license, do I still have AGPL obligations?
Commercial terms vary, but generally the commercial license is an alternative set of rights and obligations that replaces AGPL obligations for the covered use. The signed agreement controls.

### Do you offer exceptions without a paid license?
Possibly. Please contact Johannes Blaschke (johannes@blaschke.science).
